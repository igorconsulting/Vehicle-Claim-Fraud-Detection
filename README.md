# Vehicle-Claim-Fraud-Detection

Insurance fraud, as defined by the California Department of Insurance, occurs when someone knowingly lies to obtain a benefit or advantage to which they are not otherwise entitled or someone knowingly denies a benefit that is due and to which someone is entitled. According to the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud, insurance fraud, as a whole, occurs in about 10% of property-casualty insurance losses and steals at least $308.6 billion every year from consumers in the United States. Medical care fraud alone accounts for an estimated cost of $60 billion every year.

Vehicles are also an essential source of insurance fraud, which consists of false or exaggerated claims related to property damage or personal injuries. Some common fraud practices are staged accidents, phantom passengers or exaggerated injuries. With that said, this project focuses on vehicle fraud claims.
